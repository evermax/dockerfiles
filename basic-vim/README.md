To build from this repo :```docker build -t dirichlet/basic .```To run this image and work on vim inside a container```docker run -i -t dirichlet/basic /bin/bash```That way, it is quite useless because nothing is saved.But it you add something like this:```docker run -v ~/workspace:/workspace -i -t dirichlet/basic /bin/bash```It will share the workspace directory from your home directory and you'll be able to share something!
